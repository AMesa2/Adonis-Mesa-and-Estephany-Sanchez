🍿 What’s This Project About?
Movie Explorer is a website that helps people find movies and TV shows they’ll enjoy. With so many streaming platforms and options out there, it can be hard to decide what to watch. Our site makes it easier by showing trending content, letting users search by name or genre, and saving shows to a personal watchlist. We use the IMDb-API to get all our movie and TV show info.

📁 What Each File Does
homepage.html – The main page. Shows popular movies and TV shows and lets users search or go to other pages.

about.html – Explains what the site does and why it was made. Includes charts showing movie and TV show genres.

watchlist.html – Shows the user’s saved list of movies and TV shows.

styles.css – Makes the website look good. Handles layout, colors, fonts, and how things look on phones, tablets, or computers.

about.js – JavaScript file that creates the genre charts on the About page using Chart.js.

script.js (optional) – Can be used for features like searching or updating the watchlist.
